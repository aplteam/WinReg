# Dealing with the Windows Registry


## Overview

This class offers methods useful to deal with the Windows Registry without using .NET. It uses `âŽ•NA` calls to the appropriate Windows API.

`WinReg` is a powerful class that offers plenty of methods. If you just want to read, write and/or delete values from the Windows Registry then the much smaller class [WinRegSimple](https://github.com/aplteam/WinRegSimple) might be sufficient.


## Terminology

To understand the names of the methods you need to understand the terminology. If you find the terminology strange: so do I, but it was invented by Microsoft and therefore defines the standard. That is the reason why I decided to go for it: it makes it easier to understand the Microsoft documentation but also to understand others while talking about the Windows Registry.

In this picture:

![](EditReg.jpg)

you can see this string:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Dyalog\Dyalog APL/W 12.0 Unicode\AutoComplete
```

at the top of the window.


### HKEY_CURRENT_USER
This is called a "Main key". There are a number of pre-defined main keys available you can choose from. There is also a shortcut available: instead of '''HKEY_CURRENT_USER''' you can use '''HKCU'''.


### SOFTWARE\Dyalog\Dyalog APL/W 12.0 Unicode

This is called a '''sub key'''.

On the right side you see a list. The entries in this list are called _values_. Therefore "CancelKey1" is a value.

Note that the _names_ are called _values_; the actual data saved under a value is called _data_.

## Restrictions

Note the following restrictions:

 * `PutValue` supports DWORDs (REG_DWORD)
 * `PutBinary` supports REG_BINARY 
 * `PutString` and `GetString` support strings (REG_SZ), nested strings (REG_MULTI_SZ) and expanded strings (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
 * `GetValue` supports all data types.

Other data types can be requested via `GetValue`; however, writing them is not supported.
